# Open Energy - Thinking inside a box

Waterproof sensor boxes for on-the-go IoT.


## Running

Copy the code in each file to a file on http://build.particle.io and run!

## Wiring

All pins on the photon/electron are 5V tolerant except A3 and DAC. So plug your 5V boards right in!

At the top of each file is documentation of where to connect the sensors.
